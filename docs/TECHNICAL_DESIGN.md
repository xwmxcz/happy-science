> target design; sections mixing built vs planned are noted inline.

## 1. Technical goals

A high-performance, open-source research workbench with Windows / Linux installers.
Design priorities: fast startup; smooth UI; simple install; replaceable agent runtime;
local and sandboxed execution; MCP / skills / workflow support; artifact provenance;
extensibility to Jupyter, HPC, Modal, Docker, and remote servers.

## 3. Tauri over Electron

### 3.1 Recommendation

v1 uses **Tauri 2 + React + TypeScript + Vite**. Not Electron.

Reasons: Tauri is lighter with smaller installers; it uses the OS-native WebView,
suited to tool-type desktop apps; it is cross-platform (Windows / Linux); it
allows any frontend framework; and a Rust backend is well-suited to local files,
security, process management, and sidecar orchestration. Tauri positions itself around
small, fast, secure cross-platform apps built from a single codebase.

### 3.2 When Electron might fit

If later needs arise — complex browser capabilities, a more mature desktop ecosystem,
identical embedded Chromium behavior, or many native Node.js modules — Electron could be
reconsidered. But Happy Science's core is the workbench, files, agent, runtime, and
artifacts, which do not need Chromium-level capabilities, so Tauri fits better.

## 4. Frontend

### 4.1 Stack

React · TypeScript · Vite · Tailwind CSS · Radix UI · TanStack Query · Zustand ·
React Router · Monaco Editor · Markdown renderer · ECharts / Plotly / Observable Plot.

### 4.2 Module layout

```text
src/
  app/{routes,layout,providers}
  components/{sidebar,topbar,command-palette,cards,artifact-viewer,
             approval-dialog,tool-call-card,code-viewer,markdown-viewer}
  features/{onboarding,projects,chat,agent-runtime,literature,artifacts,
            provenance,review,skills,settings}
  lib/{api,events,store,theme}
```

### 4.3 UI performance strategy

Streaming chat render; virtualized log lists; lazy file tree; paginated CSV; chunked
large-Markdown render; on-demand figures; cached artifact previews; a unified agent
event bus; all heavy work off to sidecar / worker; the Tauri main process does system
capabilities only, not heavy computation.

## 5. Mission kernel and agent executor

### 5.0 Happy Science-owned mission kernel

`crates/osd-core/src/missions.rs` is the single owner of research mission
contracts. It compiles a versioned mission plan from a mission kind and rigor
level, persists lifecycle records under `.happy-science/missions.jsonl`, and
checks required deliverables independently of the executor's textual claims.
The Tauri bridge and authenticated `/v1/missions` gateway routes are adapters to
the same headless API. React contains display copy and quick-tool prompts only;
it does not duplicate research mission prompts, artifact paths, or quality gates.

OpenCode remains a replaceable execution engine. A mission is planned by the
Happy Science kernel first, the compiled execution request is sent to OpenCode,
and the resulting session is bound back to the persisted mission. This boundary
allows later ACP or other executors without moving the scientific contract.

Evidence-bearing missions also require a mission-scoped Claim–Evidence Graph
at `evidence/<mission-id>.claims.jsonl` and a source manifest at
`evidence/<mission-id>.sources.jsonl`. `crates/osd-core/src/evidence.rs` owns
its strict schema: stable claim/evidence IDs, a `supports` / `contradicts` /
`qualifies` stance, DOI or HTTP(S) source identity, exact source excerpt, and a
page/section/figure/table locator. Unknown fields, duplicate evidence IDs,
untraceable sources, empty excerpts, and malformed rows fail the deterministic
`claim-evidence-valid` gate. The same owner derives the contestation graph:
claim and source counts, contested claims with both supporting and contradicting
edges, and qualified-only claims. Reusing a claim ID with different text or a
source ID with a different title fails the gate. Conflicting evidence is
preserved as a first-class relation rather than silently collapsed into a single
generated answer.

`crates/osd-core/src/sources.rs` owns the source snapshot contract. Each source
record binds a DOI or URL and stable title to its final retrieval URL, retrieval
time, a UTF-8 snapshot below `evidence/snapshots/`, and a SHA-256 digest. Mission
checking stays offline and deterministic: it recomputes each digest, rejects
path traversal or duplicate identities, and requires every evidence quote to be
an exact substring of its declared source snapshot. Network retrieval remains a
separate, explicitly approved operation rather than a side effect of validation.

### 5.1 Choice: OpenCode (bundled)

The agent runtime is **OpenCode** (`anomalyco/opencode`, MIT), pinned to a stable
release (`OPENCODE_VERSION`, currently 1.18.12). It is distributed as a **single
binary**, which makes it ideal to bundle as a desktop sidecar — no Python/Node runtime
to package. It supports MCP, skills, and agents, is model-agnostic (BYOK), and serves as
an open-source coding/agent runtime in the spirit of Claude Code.

OpenCode exposes an HTTP + SSE server (`opencode serve`) that a GUI can drive directly —
sessions, prompts, streaming assistant/tool output, skills, and agents.

### 5.2 Desktop ↔ OpenCode communication

The app talks to OpenCode over its HTTP + SSE API, wrapped by `packages/sdk`
(`OpenCodeClient`). Key endpoints:

| Endpoint | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /session` · `GET /session` | Create / list sessions (conversation history) |
| `GET /session/:id/message` | Load a session's history |
| `POST /session/:id/prompt_async` | Send a prompt |
| `GET /event` (SSE) | Stream `message.part.updated` (text/tool), `session.idle`, `session.error` |
| `GET /api/skill` · `GET /agent` | Real loaded skills / agents |

Flow:

```text
App launch → Rust starts the bundled `opencode serve` (dedicated free port)
↓
OpenCodeClient opens GET /event (SSE) and creates/loads sessions
↓
Prompt → POST /session/:id/prompt_async
↓
SSE streams message.part.updated / session.idle → folded into thread blocks by part/call id
↓
Frontend renders streaming messages, tool cards, and per-session history
```

### 5.3 Bundling & isolation (no interference)

OpenCode is bundled as a Tauri **sidecar** (`externalBin`, one binary per target triple,
git-ignored and fetched by `scripts/dev/fetch-opencode.sh`). The Rust side
(`src-tauri/src/runtime.rs`) starts it so it never collides with a user's own OpenCode:

- runs the **bundled** binary (not the user's `PATH`);
- on a **dedicated free port** (not the default 4096);
- with an **app-private** config/data dir via `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`XDG_DATA_HOME` under
  `~/Library/Application Support/com.happyscience.desktop/runtime/` (macOS) — so the user's
  sessions/config are never touched;
- but it **shares the user's login**: the user's `auth.json` (OpenCode credentials / free
  access) is copied read-only into the sandbox at startup, so the bundled runtime can
  reply out of the box without a separate login. We only read the user's auth file; we
  never modify it or their sessions.
- killed on app exit.

The user's model provider key (entered in Settings) is written into that app-private
`opencode.json` by the `configure_opencode` Rust command, and the sidecar is restarted
to pick it up. Keys never enter the user's global OpenCode config, logs, or git.

## 6. Skills & MCP

### 6.1 Skill layering

```text
skills/
  core/      # reproducible-research, literature-review, figure-provenance,
             # citation-reviewer, paper-to-report
  external/  # K-Dense scientific-agent-skills
  user/      # custom skills
```

### 6.2 v1 built-in skills

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `reproducible-research` | Standardize project structure, artifacts, logs, reproducibility |
| `literature-review` | Search, filter, summarize literature |
| `bibliometric-analysis` | Year trends, keywords, journal distribution, clustering |
| `figure-provenance` | Figures must trace to code and data |
| `citation-reviewer` | Check citation format and sources |
| `paper-to-report` | Generate a Markdown report |

### 6.3 Third-party skills

`K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills` (large set; compatible with Cursor, Claude Code,
Codex, OpenCode) can be added later. Do **not** enable all ~148 skills by default: use
curated install, enable by domain, and show license, dependencies, and risk. (Curated
third-party install is a later feature; today the Skills page lists the real skills
OpenCode has loaded — built-in + project `.opencode/skill/` + user config.)

### 6.4 MCP servers

First batch: `filesystem` (project files), `paper-search-mcp` (literature), `BioMCP`
(biomedical databases), `Zotero MCP` (library), `GitHub MCP` (repos/issues/releases),
`local runtime MCP` (execution status). v1 ships filesystem + paper search first;
BioMCP and Zotero follow.

## 7. Execution layer

```text
Execution Layer
├── OpenCode tools (local, in the bundled runtime)
├── Docker sandbox            (optional, advanced)
├── SSH / Modal remote        (optional, advanced — later)
└── Jupyter Kernel Gateway    (later)
```

OpenCode executes its tools locally within the bundled runtime, gated by its permission
system. Heavier/remote execution (Docker sandbox, SSH, Modal) is optional and belongs in
an advanced "Remote Compute" area, never the default path.

**v1 default:** local execution + manual approval for high-risk actions. Do not
hard-depend on Docker Desktop or WSL in v1 — that raises the install barrier and is not
consumer-grade.

**v0.3 Jupyter Kernel Gateway** for a more notebook-like experience:

```text
Desktop App → Local Runtime Manager → Jupyter Kernel Gateway → Python / R kernel
→ stream output / figures / tables
```

Jupyter Kernel Gateway is a headless Jupyter kernel server addressable over REST /
WebSocket.

## 8. Local Runtime Manager

### 8.1 Why

The installer should not bundle every scientific dependency (huge installer, slow
updates, cross-platform pain, dependency conflicts, hard debugging). Instead: a
lightweight installer + a first-launch Runtime Manager + on-demand scientific env.

### 8.2 Responsibilities

Detect OpenCode; detect Python / uv / Node / Git; create the workspace; create isolated
environments; install base Python packages; manage scientific tool dependencies; start
the OpenCode server; start an optional Jupyter Gateway; monitor runtime health.

### 8.3 Runtime directory

```text
~/.ai4s-workbench/
  config/  runtime/{opencode,python,node}/  profiles/ai4s-workbench/
  workspaces/  logs/  cache/  secrets/
```

Windows: `%APPDATA%/com.happyscience.desktop/` · macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.happyscience.desktop/`

## 9. Storage

### 9.1 Project structure

```text
workspace/
  project.json  plan.md
  data/{raw,processed}/  papers/  parsed/  scripts/  notebooks/
  figures/  reports/  artifacts/  reviews/
  provenance.jsonl  manifest.json
```

### 9.2 SQLite

Stores: project list, session index, artifact index, literature metadata index,
tool-call state, user settings, runtime state.

### 9.3 JSONL

`provenance.jsonl` is an append-only execution record — easy to read, diff, recover,
export, and open-source friendly.

## 10. Artifact provenance

### 10.1 Manifest

```json
{
  "project_id": "bci-trends",
  "created_at": "",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "id": "fig_year_trend",
      "type": "figure",
      "path": "figures/year_trend.png",
      "created_by_step": "step_004",
      "input_files": ["data/processed/corpus.csv"],
      "code_files": ["scripts/analyze.py"],
      "status": "reviewed"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 10.2 Provenance event

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_001",
  "step_id": "step_004",
  "type": "code_execution",
  "tool": "python",
  "command": "python scripts/analyze.py",
  "input_files": ["data/processed/corpus.csv"],
  "output_files": ["figures/year_trend.png"],
  "started_at": "",
  "finished_at": "",
  "status": "success"
}
```

### 10.3 Reviewer rules (v1, deterministic)

Artifact exists; output is recorded in provenance; figure has a code file; table has
source data; report includes limitations; citation has a recognizable ID; script can
be re-run.

## 11. Security

### 11.1 Default permissions

The agent may only access the current workspace; command execution requires approval;
it cannot delete files outside the workspace; it cannot read the whole Home directory;
it cannot auto-upload files; it cannot silently install dependencies.

### 11.2 Approval levels

| Action | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Read current project files | Allow |
| Write current project files | Allow (shown) |
| Overwrite file | Ask |
| Delete file | Require approval |
| Shell command | Require approval |
| Install dependency | Require approval |
| Network access | First-time approval |
| Connect remote server | Require approval |
| Access files outside workspace | Require approval |

OpenCode has a per-tool permission system (allow / ask / deny per agent). The desktop
maps high-risk actions to "ask" and must never blanket-allow them.

### 11.3 API keys

Stored in macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager (fallback: encrypted local
secrets). Never enter provenance, logs, crash reports, git, or exported projects.

## 12. Packaging & release

### 12.1 Windows

Outputs: an NSIS `Setup.exe` installed per user (no admin prompt) as the default
download, plus a WiX `.msi` for IT-managed deployment. Two installers for one app
means two independent uninstall registrations, so they are labelled by audience
and users are told to stay on one; the NSIS installer's WiX-migration path is
fragile and best avoided rather than relied on. The uninstaller kills the bundled
sidecars first via `src-tauri/nsis/hooks.nsh` — without that a surviving
`opencode.exe` locks the install directory and the next upgrade fails with
"Unable to uninstall!" (issue #113). `src-tauri/nsis/English.nsh` overrides the
installer strings that decide whether a user keeps their data: the delete-app-data
checkbox names what it erases, and the upgrade choice names the safe option.
Unsigned apps run but may trigger
SmartScreen; formal release needs a code-signing certificate (EV certs earn SmartScreen
reputation faster). Early GitHub Release preview builds may be unsigned, but the README
must say so.

### 12.2 Linux

Outputs: `.deb` and `.rpm` packages for x86_64 Linux.

### 12.3 Auto update

Tauri updater with GitHub Releases + `latest.json` + a Tauri updater signature (update
packages must be signed; signature verification cannot be disabled). v0.1 no forced
auto-update; v0.2 adds a GitHub Releases updater; v0.3 adds in-app update prompts.

### 12.4 CI/CD

GitHub Actions build matrix:

```yaml
windows-latest:
  - x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
ubuntu-22.04:
  - x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

The official Tauri GitHub Action builds native binaries for Linux / Windows and
uploads to a GitHub Release.

## 13. Process model

### 13.1 Startup

```text
User opens app → Tauri starts → Frontend loads → Runtime Manager checks dependencies
→ Start OpenCode sidecar → Connect to Gateway → Load projects → Ready
```

### 13.2 Agent task

```text
User submits task → Frontend sends prompt to OpenCode → OpenCode plans
→ Frontend renders plan approval card → User approves → OpenCode executes tools
→ Tool events stream back → Runtime writes artifacts → Provenance service records events
→ Reviewer runs checks → Frontend updates artifact/review panels
```

## 14. High-performance design

### 14.1 UI

Layered state: UI state in Zustand, server/runtime state in TanStack Query, streaming
events in an event bus. Big-data optimizations: paginated CSV preview, virtualized log
viewer, lazy Markdown render, lazy artifact load. Render optimizations: memoized
tool-call cards, batched message chunks, `requestAnimationFrame` batching, background
task workers.

### 14.2 Runtime

Persistent OpenCode server; reused project sessions; incremental file index; artifact
hash cache; per-project reused Python env; literature metadata cache; cached PDF parse
results; figure preview thumbnails.

### 14.3 Startup targets

```text
App UI cold start: < 3s
Runtime ready: < 10s
First agent response: < 5s after runtime ready
```

Strategy: UI first, runtime after; show runtime-loading state on Home; a failed OpenCode
connection must not block the UI; first-time dependency install happens in onboarding.

## 15. Error handling

### 15.1 Runtime errors

OpenCode not started; Gateway start failure; port in use; missing API key; model
connection failure; workspace permission denied; broken Python env; Docker unavailable;
MCP server start failure. Each must provide: a human-readable explanation, collapsible
technical details, a one-click fix button, and a copy-logs button.

### 15.2 Agent errors

Tool-call failure; literature source rate-limited; dependency install failure; code run
failure; file permission failure; citation check failure. Must show: the failed step,
the cause, a fallback suggestion, a retry button, and an edit-plan button.

## 16. Repository structure

Monorepo:

```text
ai4s-workbench/
  apps/desktop/{src,src-tauri}/
  packages/{ui,shared,sdk}/
  runtime/{manager,opencode-profile,mcp,skills}/
  docs/{PRD.md,TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md}
  examples/bci-trends/
  scripts/{release,dev}/     # dev/fetch-opencode.sh fetches the pinned sidecar
```

- `apps/desktop` — Tauri + React desktop app; `src-tauri/src/runtime.rs` supervises the
  bundled OpenCode sidecar (`OpenCodeClient` lives in `packages/sdk`).
- `runtime/manager` — local runtime manager (detect deps, workspace, provenance, logs).
- `runtime/opencode-profile` — the Happy Science OpenCode config/skills bundle.
- `runtime/skills` — self-authored scientific skills.
- `examples` — the complete demo project.

## 17. v0.1 task breakdown

### 17.1 Day-one goals

1. Init Tauri + React.
2. Build the main layout.
3. Build a static onboarding page.
4. Build a static project workspace page.
5. Build tool-call card / artifact card / approval dialog.
6. Bundle + auto-start OpenCode; connect via `OpenCodeClient` (HTTP + SSE).
7. Ship the OpenCode config/skills bundle.
8. Write the 3 core skills.
9. Build static artifacts for the BCI demo.
10. Draft the GitHub Actions build.

### 17.2 v0.1 must deliver

Windows and Linux apps run; README has screenshots; a complete demo; API key
config; open a workspace; a bundled OpenCode the app auto-starts and drives (sessions,
streaming, history, skills); show plan / tool / artifact / review; export `report.md`.

## 18. Technical risks

### 18.1 OpenCode desktop integration

Risk: OpenCode API changes across versions. Mitigation: wrap `OpenCodeClient`; never call
OpenCode directly from the UI; **pin the OpenCode version** (`OPENCODE_VERSION`); bundle
the pinned binary so the app is not affected by the user's own OpenCode.

### 18.2 Windows environment complexity

Risk: WebView2, permissions, Defender, SmartScreen, PATH, missing Python / Git / Node.
Mitigation: the Runtime Manager detects the environment; do not hard-depend on system
Python early; provide a portable fallback; code-sign for formal releases.

### 18.3 Installer size

Risk: bundling a large runtime and scientific packages makes the installer huge.
Mitigation: OpenCode is a single ~44 MB-installer sidecar (cheap to bundle); keep the app
body light; install heavy scientific dependencies on demand as optional Science Packs;
defer Docker / Jupyter.

### 18.4 Agent safety

Risk: the agent runs commands, reads/writes files, accesses the network. Mitigation:
manual approval by default; workspace allowlist; isolated local secrets; dangerous-
command dialogs; optional Docker sandbox; full provenance recording.

## 19. Final stack

```text
Tauri 2
React + TypeScript + Vite
Tailwind + Radix UI
OpenCode as agent runtime (bundled single-binary sidecar, pinned OPENCODE_VERSION)
OpenCode HTTP + SSE API via OpenCodeClient (packages/sdk)
OpenCode skills/agents + optional third-party scientific skills
Local workspace + SQLite + JSONL provenance
DMG / NSIS / MSI installers via GitHub Actions
GitHub Releases (self-contained; sidecar fetched at build time)
```

One line:

**Use Tauri for a high-performance modern desktop shell, a bundled+isolated OpenCode as
the Claude Code alternative layer, scientific skills and MCP as the research capability
layer, and provenance/reviewer as the real moat of an open-source Claude Science alternative.**
