# Happy Science — Product Requirements

> **Status (v0.1, 2026-07-02).** The runtime is **OpenCode**, bundled as an isolated
> sidecar (one-click, auto-started, does not touch a user's own OpenCode). Built: the
> three-column workbench UI, real multi-session chat with history, a real Skills/Agents
> view, BYOK key config, and a macOS installer. Literature search, provenance/reviewer,
> code-execution backends, and Science Packs below are the target scope, not all shipped.

## 1. Positioning

**Happy Science** is an open-source AI research workbench with macOS /
Windows installers, positioned as an **open-source alternative to Claude Science
style products**.

It is not an ordinary paper-summarization tool. It is a local-first, model-agnostic,
reproducible, auditable research agent workbench that helps researchers do:

- Literature search
- Paper parsing
- Data analysis
- Code execution
- Figure generation
- Report writing
- Citation checking
- Artifact provenance
- Reusable research workflows

Slogan:

> Open-source AI research workbench for reproducible science.

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Phase 1 goal

Phase 1 must be a genuinely installable desktop app, not a CLI tool.

Required support:

| Platform | Installer | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `.dmg` / `.app` | P0 |
| macOS Intel | `.dmg` / `.app` | P1 |
| Windows x64 | `.exe` NSIS installer | P0 |
| Windows x64 | `.msi` installer (IT-managed deployment) | P1 |

Tauri can package `dmg`, `app`, `nsis`, and `msi` targets. Windows ships both:
NSIS is the default download and the only target supporting per-user install,
while the MSI serves Group Policy / Intune deployment and has taken 6-10% of
Windows downloads every release. They are labelled by audience rather than
offered as equals — installing one over the other registers the app twice.

### 2.2 Differentiation

Versus ordinary AI paper tools, Happy Science is different because it is:

1. A research workbench, not a chat box.
2. A generator of traceable artifacts, not just text.
3. Model-agnostic (BYOK / OpenRouter / OpenAI-compatible / local), not tied to one model.
4. Transparent — it keeps code, data, figures, reports, logs, and provenance — not a black box.
5. Multi-domain — expanding from biology to AI4S, materials, chemistry, biology,
   medicine, engineering, and industry.

## 3. Target users

### 3.1 Core users

1. **Researchers** — fast literature reviews; organizing papers, data, figures,
   reports; reproducibility and citation accuracy.
2. **AI4S / AI-for-Science developers** — integrating scientific skills, MCP, and
   database connectors into one workbench; an open-source Claude Science alternative.
3. **Grad / PhD / postdoc students** — topic surveys, paper reading, experiment data
   analysis, submission material prep.
4. **Open-source AI agent users** — already using OpenCode, Codex, Claude Code, Cursor,
   MCP, Agent Skills; want a research-focused desktop product.

### 3.2 Non-target users (Phase 1)

- Complete beginners who cannot configure an API key.
- Users needing clinical diagnosis or medical decisions.
- Institutions needing multi-user collaborative SaaS.
- Teams needing enterprise permissions, audit, or SSO.

## 4. Core product principles

### 4.1 Local-first

Runs on the user's machine by default. Project files, corpora, figures, reports, and
execution logs are stored in a local workspace.

### 4.2 Model-agnostic

No lock-in to Claude, OpenAI, or any single local model. Users can choose OpenRouter,
OpenAI-compatible APIs, the Anthropic API, or local models; Ollama / vLLM / LM Studio
support follows.

### 4.3 Reproducibility-first

Every important artifact must be traceable:

| Artifact | Must trace to |
| --- | --- |
| Figure | generating code, input data, parameters |
| Report | citation sources, data sources, analysis steps |
| Table | raw data, cleaning script |
| Conclusion | citations, data, model output |
| Agent action | time, tool, input, output, status |

### 4.4 Human-in-the-loop

High-risk actions — file writes, command execution, dependency installs, network
access, file deletion, remote compute — require user approval. The bundled OpenCode runtime provides
dangerous-command approval, container isolation, MCP credential filtering, and
cross-session isolation.

## 5. MVP scope

### 5.1 P0 features

#### 5.1.1 Install & first launch

After downloading and first opening, the user enters onboarding:

1. Choose a model provider.
2. Enter an API key.
3. Choose a workspace directory.
4. Detect the local runtime environment.
5. Use the bundled OpenCode runtime (auto-started; no separate install).
6. Create the first research project.

First launch must clearly tell the user: data is stored locally by default; the agent
requests authorization before running commands; the user must supply their own model
API key; research results need human verification and are not final conclusions.

#### 5.1.2 Home

Shows: recent projects, new project, example workflows, current runtime status, model
connection status, local workspace status.

Recommended default examples: Literature Review, Bibliometric Analysis,
Paper-to-Report, Dataset Analysis, Citation Review, Reproducibility Audit.

#### 5.1.3 Research agent workspace

The main work area, in a three-column layout:

```text
Left:   projects / workflows / files
Middle: agent chat + plan + execution progress
Right:  artifacts / citations / review / run logs
```

Core interaction: user submits a task → agent produces a plan → user confirms →
agent runs tools → each step shows status → artifacts land in the Artifact panel →
reviewer checks automatically → user exports the report.

#### 5.1.4 Plan confirmation

For multi-step tasks the agent must produce a plan before executing.

```text
Goal:
Data sources:
Steps:
Expected artifacts:
Risks & limitations:
Actions requiring authorization:
```

User options: Approve · Edit Plan · Run Step by Step · Cancel.

#### 5.1.5 Literature search

v1 sources: arXiv, PubMed, Crossref, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar (optional API key),
local PDF import.

Features: keyword search; filter by year and source; dedup; export `corpus.csv`; save
search logs; record data-source limits.

#### 5.1.6 Skills library

The Skills page lists the **real** skills and agents the OpenCode runtime has loaded
(built-in + project `.opencode/skill/` + user config) — no hardcoded catalog. Skill
sources, layered:

1. **OpenCode built-in** skills/agents (shipped with the runtime).
2. **Self-authored AI4S skills** — planned: `literature-review`, `reproducible-analysis`,
   `citation-reviewer`, `figure-provenance`, `paper-to-report` (Markdown skills under
   `runtime/skills/core`, loaded from the workspace `.opencode/skill/`).
3. **Third-party scientific skills** — e.g. K-Dense `scientific-agent-skills` (curated
   install, a later feature).

K-Dense `scientific-agent-skills` is a collection for science/research; its README
describes ~148 skills and compatibility with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, and
other Agent Skills hosts.

#### 5.1.7 Code execution

v1 languages: Python, Shell (R later).

| Mode | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Local | Run directly in the local workspace |
| Docker | Run in an isolated container |
| SSH | Remote server execution (later) |
| Modal | Cloud execution (later) |
| Jupyter Kernel | Notebook-style persistent kernel (later) |

OpenCode runs tools locally inside the bundled runtime by default; Docker sandbox and
SSH / Modal remote execution are optional advanced backends, so the desktop starts local
and expands later.

#### 5.1.8 Artifact panel

All outputs land here. Types: Markdown reports, CSV tables, PNG / SVG figures, PDFs,
Python scripts, notebooks, JSONL provenance, review reports.

Each artifact shows: filename, type, created time, generating step, input data,
generating code, review status, and export / copy / open actions.

#### 5.1.9 Provenance

Each project auto-generates `provenance.jsonl`, `manifest.json`, and `review.md`.

`provenance.jsonl` records each step, append-only:

```json
{
  "step_id": "step_001",
  "type": "literature_search",
  "tool": "openalex",
  "input": {},
  "output_files": ["data/corpus.csv"],
  "timestamp": "",
  "status": "success"
}
```

#### 5.1.10 Reviewer panel

v1 reviewer does basic checks: citations exist; DOI / PMID / arXiv IDs are
well-formed; figures have generating code; tables have source data; reports include
limitations; no untraced artifacts; no steps the agent claims but never ran.

## 6. UI design requirements

### 6.1 Keywords

Modern, restrained, refined, research feel, tool feel — not flashy, not a traditional
admin panel, not a low-quality AI wrapper. Reference vibes: Linear's simplicity,
Cursor's technical feel, Notion's information structure, Raycast's command palette,
Vercel's cleanliness, Claude's warmth.

### 6.2 Visual style

Light theme (default):

| Use | Suggestion |
| --- | --- |
| Background | warm white / soft gray |
| Primary | deep indigo / blue violet |
| Accent | teal / cyan |
| Success | soft green |
| Warning | amber |
| Error | soft red |
| Text | near black / slate |

Dark theme:

| Use | Suggestion |
| --- | --- |
| Background | near black / deep navy |
| Card | dark slate |
| Primary | blue violet |
| Accent | cyan |
| Text | soft white |

### 6.3 Main layout

## 7. Key interactions

### 7.1 Plan card

Must be clean and clear. Contains: goal, step list, tools to call, expected artifacts,
risk notes, run buttons. Buttons: Approve & Run · Edit Plan · Run Step-by-step ·
Save as Workflow.

### 7.2 Tool-call card

Shows: tool name, status, input summary, output summary, duration, token / cost
(optional), view details, copy log. Status: Pending · Running · Waiting Approval ·
Success · Warning · Failed.

### 7.3 Approval dialog

For dangerous actions — delete file, overwrite file, install package, run shell,
network access, connect remote server, upload file — a dialog must confirm. Options:
Allow Once · Always Allow for This Project · Deny · View Details.

### 7.4 Command palette

Shortcut: `Cmd + K` (macOS) / `Ctrl + K` (Windows). Quick actions: new project, search
literature, run reviewer, open settings, switch model, install skill, export report.

## 8. MVP example workflow

v1 must ship one complete demo:

```text
2023–2026 brain-computer interface literature trends
```

Outputs: `plan.md`, `data/corpus.csv`, `scripts/analyze.py`, `figures/year_trend.png`,
`figures/topic_clusters.png`, `figures/top_keywords.png`, `report.md`, `review.md`,
`provenance.jsonl`. Used for README, website, screenshots, video, and launch.

## 9. Roadmap

Tracked as GitHub milestones; issue numbers are the source of truth for scope
discussion. Shipped versions are kept here as the delivery record.

### Shipped

- **v0.1.x Desktop MVP → hardening** — macOS / Windows / Linux installers, local
  workspace, bundled OpenCode runtime, model config, agent chat, plan approval,
  Python analysis, artifact panel, `provenance.jsonl`, notebooks (Python + R),
  science MCP connectors, remote compute (SSH / Slurm / Modal), projects,
  searchable model browser, network proxy + mirrors, 7 UI languages.
- **v0.2.0 UI & reliability** — three themes (light / warm / dark) with per-theme
  accents, translucent macOS sidebar, Codex-style settings (section routes +
  sidebar navigation), in-app zoom, provider retry/error surfacing, OAuth
  recovery via the credential store, git-snapshot bloat guards, first Zenodo DOI.
- **v0.2.1 – v0.2.2 Patches** — traffic-light re-pin on the transparent/vibrancy
  window, session history loading after a hard reload of `/live/:id`,
  theme-aware code highlighting (dark-mode readability).
- **v0.2.3 Reach & interop, delivered early** — the **authenticated API gateway**
  and its first three clients: a CLI, a LAN web browser, and a phone, all
  running the *real* desktop UI over HTTP+SSE. Loopback by default, LAN an
  explicit opt-in, token embedded in a copyable link, provider keys never
  leaving the machine (#3). Plus browser control (drive the user's own Chrome).
  This is the deliverable v0.4.0 below was written around — it shipped here
  instead, which is why that entry is now only about what it did *not* cover.
- **v0.2.4 Model limits & streaming** — custom-endpoint models carry a context
  limit (auto-detected, else 128k) so the agent compacts before overflowing and
  local models stop looping in long chats (#49); streaming Markdown/math parse
  throttled so long turns stay responsive (#50).
- **v0.2.5 Composer control** — model + reasoning-effort switcher in the
  composer, built from each model's own variants (#48, #40); bracket-delimited
  `\(…\)` / `\[…\]` math renders (#51).
- **v0.3.0 Research UX + split panes** — the "scientist's daily loop": LaTeX /
  math rendering and image upload → multimodal prompts (#22), system-level
  notifications when the agent is blocked on a permission or question (#21),
  and N-ary split-pane tiling — drag-to-dock, screens/groups, per-pane model,
  deferred session creation with per-pane drafts.
- **v0.3.1 Signed distribution** — first Developer ID signed, notarized and
  stapled macOS builds (v0.3.0 and earlier shipped unsigned), plus
  local-first project workflow and long-session fixes.
- **v0.3.2 Field fixes** — the Skills page no longer reports the app's own
  bundled `uv` and managed Jupyter as "not found" (#68); a session started in a
  project is created there, each draft carrying its own destination (#69).
- **v0.3.3 Runtime, clusters & review** — bundled OpenCode 1.17.13 → 1.18.12 so
  the model catalog and reasoning efforts are current (#74); interactive SSH
  sign-in, making clusters that demand a password or one-time code per
  connection usable (#73); a bundled read-only `reviewer` agent with opt-in
  auto-review (#72); per-agent reasoning effort (#71); Windows projects match
  their sessions across path spellings (#76); zoom no longer restructures the
  desktop into phone layout (#63).
- **v0.4.0 ACP, both directions** — the app now speaks the Agent Client Protocol
  as a client *and* as an agent (#14, design in `docs/rfc/multi-agent-acp.md`),
  both on the one runtime-agnostic `AgentRuntime` seam rather than a surface per
  feature. Northbound, `AcpRuntime` drives any ACP agent (Codex, Gemini CLI,
  Claude Code, …) through the ordinary UI, Rust-supervised, with listing,
  history replay, the agent's own model / reasoning selectors, this app's MCP
  connectors and survival across an agent restart — all capability-gated on what
  each agent advertises. Southbound, external editors (Zed, JetBrains, Neovim,
  …) spawn `acp-server.mjs` from inside the bundle and drive Open Science in
  ACP's dialect, reusing the shipped gateway and its token. Alongside it: a
  subagent opens into its own transcript (#105); a configured per-agent model
  actually runs the turn (#96); `resolve_artifact` moved off the UI thread,
  which was the real cause of the split-pane freeze (#92); image attachments ride
  as multimodal parts (#97); the notebook gained Jupyter's edit/command split and
  stable cell identity (#98, #100); the agent's questions can always be answered
  in the user's own words (#109); plus traffic-light alignment, non-Latin
  provider names (#90, #94) and per-screen composer isolation (#95).

### Planned

- **v0.3.x Remaining research UX** — the one item from the v0.3.0 milestone still
  open: plan-first workflow (surface OpenCode's plan mode as an explicit "plan,
  review, then execute" loop) and adaptive approvals — documenting and refining
  the risk tiers between "approve dangerous only" and "full access" (#20).
- **v0.4.x The rest of the reach surfaces** — the gateway itself, the LAN web UI
  and the CLI shipped in v0.2.3 and ACP shipped in v0.4.0, so what is left of
  this axis is the interop that runs on someone else's host, plus the two ACP
  halves that are not finished. All of them still ride the one runtime-agnostic
  `AgentRuntime` seam (#24, base class #36) rather than adding a
  surface-specific entity:
  - **ACP, client direction** — still open: the agent's own sign-in
    (`authenticate` / `auth.logout` — Codex's ChatGPT login, not our provider
    keys), and `providers`, which is still a draft RFD rather than stable v1;
  - **ACP, server direction** — still open: image prompts, and the editor's own
    `fs` / `terminal` client capabilities;
  - messaging-platform integrations (Slack / Discord / Telegram / Feishu) — each
    a thin bot client that relays `sendPrompt` → streamed events (#20);
  - cloud tunnel — reach the same gateway + token over a public URL
    (cloudflared / frp / ngrok), no new API.
- **v0.5.0 Pluggable & remote runtimes (southbound)** — the same `AgentRuntime`
  seam consumed in the *other* direction: swap or relocate the execution
  backend behind a pluggable transport (in-process / HTTP / stdio-JSON-RPC /
  SSH). This axis shares the seam and base class (#36) with v0.4.x — a remote
  runtime is literally the shipped gateway consumed by a `RemoteRuntime` client,
  the two halves of one pipe.
  - remote agent runtime — run the runtime on another machine, drive it from the
    desktop over the gateway;
  - remote Jupyter + remote-first execution — connect to an existing remote
    Jupyter server and default suitable work (shell, cells, training) to a
    chosen remote target, building on the shipped SSH / Slurm compute (#35).

Ordering rationale: the v0.2.x–v0.3.x line made the core desktop loop better for
the existing research audience (small-to-medium, high frequency-of-use); the
v0.4.x–v0.5.0 line opens new surfaces (large, security-sensitive) by hardening
the one `AgentRuntime` seam rather than adding entities per feature — the API
gateway, LAN UI, and messaging bridges must not weaken the local-first /
keychain-only-secrets guarantees, and remote execution must never silently fall
back to local (#35).

Version numbers are not reserved in advance. The gateway was planned for v0.4.0
and shipped in v0.2.3 because it was ready; this section is the delivery record
kept in step with what actually went out, and a milestone number only means
"this issue is next", never "wait for that number".

## 10. Non-functional requirements

### 10.1 Performance

Cold start < 3s (excluding first-time runtime init); no noticeable UI jank; streaming
agent output; live tool-call refresh; paginated large-file preview; lazy-loaded
figures; virtualized log lists.

### 10.2 Security

API keys encrypted locally; workspace sandbox isolation; dangerous-command approval;
no file upload by default; no full-disk access for the agent by default; access limited
to the current project directory; all network access auditable.

### 10.3 Maintainability

Frontend, desktop shell, and agent runtime decoupled; pluggable skills; configurable
MCP servers; extensible model providers; stable artifact schema; versioned workflow
templates.

### 10.4 Open-source friendliness

Clear first-screen README; one-click install; one-click demo; nice screenshots;
complete example results; clear license; separate note for third-party skill licenses.

## 11. One-liner

**Happy Science is an open-source research agent workbench with macOS and
Windows installers that uses OpenCode, MCP, scientific skills, and a reproducible
artifact system to weave literature, code, figures, reports, and review into one
local-first scientific workflow.**
