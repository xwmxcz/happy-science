Happy Science — headless (osd)

Nothing to install: this directory runs as it is, on a server with no packages
added (checked on a bare Ubuntu container).

  ./osd server                 serve the workbench here (web UI + API)
  ./osd server --lan           also reachable from the network
  ./osd --help                 everything else

The web UI is the same one the desktop app runs. Open the URL it prints,
including the ?token=... it gives you.

Set the machine up before starting a server:

  ./osd auth set anthropic --key <api-key>      credentials, LOCAL to this box
  ./osd auth set openai --key <k> --base-url <url>   a self-hosted endpoint
  ./osd model set anthropic/claude-opus-4-5     the default for every turn
  ./osd model ls                                what this machine can serve
  ./osd approval                                what the agent must ask first

Or export the provider's API key before starting the server; the agent runtime
inherits this process's environment, so no key has to touch a file.

Approvals: the agent asks before running commands, deleting files, installing
dependencies or reaching the network. `--wait` prints what is waiting, and you
answer with `./osd permission allow <id>` or in the browser at the URL it shows.
For a machine with nobody watching, `./osd approval set full` never asks.

As a service, systemd runs `osd server` unchanged, and stopping the unit takes
the agent runtime with it. A unit that was tested end to end:

  [Unit]

macOS: files from a downloaded archive are quarantined. If macOS refuses to
run them, clear it once with:  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine .
