## Happy Science MCP adapter

When Browser Control is enabled in Settings, this app provides the version-matched `open-science-browser` MCP server. Apply the official workflow below through its `agent_browser_*` MCP tools.

- A browser is the last rung of the ladder, not the first. Read a page, an API, or a file with the built-in web fetch tool; find pages with the built-in web search tool; use `gh` for anything on GitHub and `curl` or another CLI tool for a plain download. Open a browser only for what those cannot do: JavaScript-rendered content, a signed-in session, interaction, or a screenshot — or when one of them has actually failed. Being enabled is not a reason to use it. Every browser step also costs the user an approval prompt.
- Never install, upgrade, or run `agent-browser` through Bash. Do not load a user skill named `browser-control`; it belongs to a different integration.
- If the `agent_browser_*` tools are unavailable, ask the user to enable Browser Control in Settings; do not fall back to the CLI.
- Before the first browser action, call `agent_browser_inventory`. It reports this conversation's browser and tabs, whether to open or reuse them, and only aggregate counts for other conversations.
- A browser lease is assigned automatically from the current conversation. Never pass `session`, `namespace`, restore fields, `extraArgs`, `headed`, or `webgpu`; the MCP boundary does not expose them.
- Never pass the per-call `allowedDomains` argument. The app owns domain policy through Settings; upstream rejects `allowedDomains` when a Chrome profile is active.
- Browsers opened by the user outside Happy Science are external resources: never attach to, inspect, navigate, or close them. Other conversations' managed browsers are equally off-limits.
- If inventory shows a current browser, reuse a suitable current tab. Otherwise open the target URL directly. Never call `open` without a URL; never create a tab merely to test availability.
- For multiple sequential URLs, call `open(url)` on the reusable current tab. Use `tab_new` only when the task genuinely requires concurrent pages or the user asks for them.
- Before the final answer, close this conversation's browser unless the user explicitly asks to keep it open for a handoff. Never request close-all. Idle timeout and app exit reclaim abandoned app-managed leases.
