// Interactive SSH sign-in for compute hosts (#73).
//
// Institutional clusters routinely ask for a password, a one-time code, or both
// on EVERY new connection. `BatchMode=yes` (compute.rs) can never answer that,
// so those machines are unusable today — not slower, unusable. Answering a
// prompt per connection would be no better: one agent run makes dozens of ssh
// calls, which would mean dozens of one-time codes.
//
// So the app does what the user would otherwise hand-configure: it opens ONE
// authenticated master connection per host over a real PTY, relays whatever the
// server asks to a dialog, and every later ssh — the app's own probes and the
// agent's `ssh`/`rsync`/`sbatch` alike — rides that master through a shared
// ControlPath and is never prompted at all. One sign-in per working session.
//
// Two deliberate non-features:
//   * Prompts are never classified. Duo, PAM, RSA and campus OTP flows word
//     themselves differently ("Password:", "Passcode or option (1-3):",
//     "Enter PIN+TOKENCODE:"); the dialog shows the server's own text and
//     relays the answer, so a flow nobody here has seen still works.
//   * Nothing is persisted. A one-time code is single-use by definition, and
//     the master's lifetime makes one prompt per working session enough.
//     Secrets go into the PTY — never a process argument, so they cannot reach
//     provenance, run records, logs or the conversation.
