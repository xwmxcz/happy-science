// `osd` on the user's PATH, without the user doing anything.
//
// The installer carries `osd` beside the app binary, so a fresh install already
// has the terminal client — it is just not reachable by name. Making it
// reachable happens on launch, not on a button: an install that leaves you a
// line to paste into your shell profile has not installed anything.
//
// Two things shape how it is done. First, what gets written is a WRAPPER, never
// a symlink: `osd` resolves its sidecars and bundled resources next to its own
// executable, and macOS does not resolve a symlink for `current_exe()` —
// measured, a symlinked `osd` dies with "bundled OpenCode binary not found".
// Second, the directory is chosen to avoid touching the user's files at all
// where possible: a directory of theirs that is ALREADY on PATH and writable
// takes it with no further change. Only when there is none does this fall back
// to `~/.local/bin` plus one guarded block in the login profile (Unix) or one
// read-modify-write of the per-user PATH (Windows) — never an admin prompt,
// never `setx` (which truncates a PATH over 1024 characters).
