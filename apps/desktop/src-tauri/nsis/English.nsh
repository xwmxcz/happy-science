; A custom language file REPLACES the bundler's built-in set rather than adding
; to it, so every string it ships has to be here. All of these are Tauri's
; defaults verbatim except the three marked below.

; --- Changed from Tauri's defaults -------------------------------------------

; Default: "Delete the application data". That names nothing, and the box is
; ticked on a screen most people click through — while it erases
; %APPDATA%\com.happyscience.desktop, which holds every session, every run record and
; the SQLite index. Say what is actually lost, in the user's own terms.
LangString deleteAppData ${LANG_ENGLISH} "Also delete my sessions, run history and settings (cannot be undone)"

; Default: "Unable to uninstall!" — a dead end that sent users to the issue
; tracker (#113) with nowhere to go. Both ways out fit in one sentence.
LangString unableToUninstall ${LANG_ENGLISH} "Could not remove the existing version. Close ${PRODUCTNAME} if it is still running and try again, or go back and choose 'Install over it' — upgrading in place is safe and keeps your data."

; Defaults: "Uninstall before installing" / "Do not uninstall". On an upgrade
; these read as a coin toss, and the wrong side of it is where the data loss
; and the uninstall failures live. Name the safe one as the safe one.
LangString uninstallBeforeInstalling ${LANG_ENGLISH} "Remove the old version first (only if an upgrade has failed)"
LangString dontUninstall ${LANG_ENGLISH} "Install over it, keeping my data (recommended)"
LangString dontUninstallDowngrade ${LANG_ENGLISH} "Install over it, keeping my data (downgrading without uninstall is disabled for this installer)"
