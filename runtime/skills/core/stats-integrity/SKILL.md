name: stats-integrity
description: Use whenever you run statistical analysis for the social sciences (regression, hypothesis tests, econometrics) or read Stata (.dta) / SPSS (.sav) data in this workspace. Enforces an execute-don't-interpret boundary (surface estimates, don't volunteer causal claims), checks the analysis against a preregistration plan for HARKing, verifies reproducible seeds, and reproduces .dta/.sav estimates via R. Flags integrity risks; never certifies the analysis is sound.

# Analysis integrity (social science)

Social science's decisive risk is not a crashing script — it is a **confident,
provocative misreading** of a correct number, silent p-hacking, and results that
don't replicate. Your job here is to **run analyses and surface raw output**, and
to **withhold interpretation the design doesn't support**.

Pepinsky's rule: *use the agent for tasks that follow rules; do not use it for
tasks that generate answers, arguments, or interpretations.*

## Execute — don't interpret

- Report the **estimate and its uncertainty** — coefficients, standard errors,
  confidence intervals, test statistics, p-values, N — exactly as the software
  produced them.
- Do **not** volunteer causal or "provocative" claims. Regression and
  correlation are **associational**. Say "X is associated with Y", not "X causes
  / drives / leads to / increases Y", unless the *design* (RCT, IV, DiD, RDD,
  panel FE with a credible identification strategy) supports it — and then name
  the design.
- Do not tell the user what they want to hear. If the result is null or
  ambiguous, say so plainly.

## Reproducible execution (fixed seeds + traceability)

- Any randomised step (bootstrap, permutation, train/test split, resampling,
  MCMC) **must fix a seed**: `np.random.seed(...)`, `random_state=...`, or R
  `set.seed(...)`.
- Every numeric claim in a report must be traceable to a **script + line +
  output** (provenance records this automatically when you write files).

## Stata / SPSS / R round-trip

Read proprietary formats with real libraries — never transcribe numbers from
memory. `.dta` and `.sav` round-trip through R (base `foreign` / `haven`) or
pandas; use a fixed seed so estimates reproduce exactly:

```r
df <- foreign::read.dta("data.dta")   # or haven::read_dta / haven::read_sav
set.seed(1)
m <- lm(y ~ x, data = df)
summary(m)                            # report coef + Std. Error verbatim
```

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_stata("data.dta")        # or pd.read_spss("data.sav")
```

Report the coefficient **and** its standard error; if you compute the same model
two ways (pandas vs R), confirm they match to the printed precision.

## Read the automatic integrity gate

Happy Science runs the deterministic gate automatically whenever it records a
local analysis execution. The result is persisted on that run in
`.openscience/runs.jsonl`; the script beside this SKILL.md only renders the
latest result as a reviewer block. Run it from the workspace before reporting
results:

```bash
python "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/skills/stats-integrity/stats_integrity_check.py"
```

It prints one ` ```review ` fenced JSON block covering three core-owned risks:

- **stats · interpretation** — causal / provocative language over an association
  in a report.
- **stats · prereg** — a predictor or interaction the code runs that a
  preregistration plan (`preregistration.md` / `analysis_plan.*` / `prereg.*` in
  the workspace) never named — a HARKing path.
- **stats · seed** — a randomised analysis with no fixed seed.

## Reporting

Copy the ` ```review ` block as the **last thing** in your message — the app
renders it as dismissible reviewer cards. Never tell the user the analysis is
"correct", "sound", or that a relationship is causal from observational data —
the gate checks specific risks only.

## Adding a check

Add detection to `crates/osd-core/src/research_integrity.rs` and test it there.
Keep `stats_integrity_check.py` as a projection of the persisted run result so
there is only one integrity contract and one rule implementation.
