 * a real terminal and relays the server's own prompts (password, one-time code,
 * push approval) to a dialog. This tool is how the agent reaches that dialog
 * mid-run instead of failing with "Permission denied" — the call itself is the
 * signal the UI acts on, and the polling below is the agent waiting for the
 * human to finish. Once it returns, every later `ssh`/`rsync`/`sbatch` on that
 * host rides the same connection and is never prompted again.
